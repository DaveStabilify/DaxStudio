As of version 2 there is now a single integrated installer which caters for both 32 and 64 bit installs and for both Excel 2010/2013/2016/365. It will also download and install any missing prerequisites.

Prerequisites (the installer will attempt to download these if they are not present):
* [.Net Framework 4.7.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56116)


## Manually Installing Dependencies
The links to the dependencies are listed above. If you need to do an offline install you may need to download and pre-install the .Net Framework if the above version or later is not already installed.
