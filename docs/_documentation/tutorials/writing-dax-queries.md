title: Writing DAX Queries
---

DAX Queries have quite a simple structure. Microsoft describes the query syntax in their documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/dax-queries). But in this guide we are going to take a very practical, example based approach. 

If you want to follow along and try out these queries yourself all you need is:
* DAX Studio
* Power BI Desktop
* the [Adventure Works 2020](https://aka.ms/dax-docs-sample-file) sample file

The simplest way to get started after installing both DAX Studio and Power BI Desktop is to open the **Adventure Works 2020.pbix** file, then click on External Tools and launch DAX Studio from there. 

> Note: This assumes you have run the default All Users install option. If you are running the "Current User" install or the portable version you will not see DAX Studio in the external tools, but if you start up DAX Studio while Power BI Desktop has the **Adventure Works 2020** file open you should be able to use the option in the connection dialog to connect to this report.
